title: "Disable Bluetooth When no Approved Device is Connected"
discussion: |
  The macOS system _MUST_ be configured to disable Bluetooth unless there is an approved device connected.

  [IMPORTANT]
  ====
  Information System Security Officers (ISSOs) may make the risk-based decision not to disable Bluetooth, so as to maintain necessary functionality, but they are advised to first fully weigh the potential risks posed to their organization. 
  ====
check: |
  /usr/bin/profiles -P -o stdout | /usr/bin/grep -c 'DisableBluetooth = 1' | /usr/bin/awk '{ if ($1 >= 1) {print "1"} else {print "0"}}'
result:
  integer: 1
fix: |
  This is implemented by a Configuration Profile.
